Getting Started
===============

Go to see the [examples](../examples/) directory to grab the code and read it.

If you want to quickly run them, you can execute them directly from the [official circle website](https://jlguenego.github.io/circle/).

Ok, let's go !

Hello {{name}}
--------------

- [Read the code](../examples/01-hello-name/)
- [Run it](https://jlguenego.github.io/circle/examples/01-hello-name/)

To use a [web component](https://www.webcomponents.org/), you need to:
- have the *circle* library imported.
- define its class.
- give it a template (optional)
- register it.
By using *circle*, you will have less boilerplate code. 

### define a class

```
```
