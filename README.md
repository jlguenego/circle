======

Official web site: (https://jlguenego.github.io/circle/)

Purpose: 
- Using the web components technologies in projects, and the other very recent web API.

- Providing templating, observable model, with the 4 kinds of databinding (1-way, 2-way, interpolation, event), Dependancy Injection.
- Library size very small.

Why Circle ?
============

A circle has no angle, is not [angular](https://angular.io/)... ;)

It would be more an alternative of [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
